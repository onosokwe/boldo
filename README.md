# Boldo 
Frontend Developer - Design Implementation Test

## The Task
* We have a sample Figma design with different screens available at this link: https://www.figma.com/file/vTw2aaaGHreAGbtvV3rQoO/Boldo---Edgar-Allan-(Community)?node-id=48%3A377

* Please review the design and choose ONLY ONE screen to implement. 
* Once completed, kindly provide us with the code link (e.g. Github) and a preview link (e.g. Vercel/netlify) 
* To ensure transparency, please note that the Figma design is neutral and has been extracted from one of the cloneable sample projects available on the Figma community. You can find the full project at this link: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1081611224529759785
* Other notes: 
* You can use strictly react or nextjs. 
* This assessment tests how accurately the developer can interpret design and write clean codes.
